# ransaq

A crawler for the [SAQ](https://www.saq.com/)'s product catalog. 

It was written as a hobby project to play around with a few libraries (notably [`sqlx`](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) and [`SQLite`](https://sqlite.org/index.html)), and has the nice side effect of producing a real-world dataset I'd like to use for further experimentation with things like [`tantivy`](https://github.com/quickwit-inc/tantivy) and [`axum`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum).

I've attemped to make somewhat useful docs (https://davidcornu.github.io/ransaq/ransaq/).
